## A program to drop TCP packets from a network device on a specified port

## Desc
- [x] The tool uses [libbpf](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf), [ebpf-go](https://ebpf-go.dev/) and [golang](https://go.dev/) on userspace.
- [x] The tool can take user configurable port and network device.
- [x] The kernel program can be found in `tcp_drop_kernel.c`.
- [x] The userspace code program can be found in `main.go`.

## Usage
```bash
    # clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/raphhawk/ebpf-programs.git

    # Install dependencies for void linux
    sudo xbps-install libbpf-devel clang linux-headers llvm make elfutils-devel bpftool bpftrace netcat go 

    # from the root of project execute the following 
    # To build the ebpf kernel program and userspace program
    make build
    
    # To run the program with default port i,e (4040) and default network i,e (loopback)
    make run
    
    # To run with user specified port/nw device/both 
    sudo ./builds/epbf_drop -port=8080 -nw=lo

    # To clean all generated elf/go binaries
